# GPS Mobility Data Analysis Take Home Task: [YOUR NAME HERE].

Goal: The goal of this test is for you to demonstrate the ability to process and analyze big datasets hosted in AWS S3 buckets, as well as skills related to data analysis and visualization.
You will read location data from FourSquare which is hosted in an S3 bucket, do some descriptive analysis and finally attempt to cluster and analyze time series data. You will then write some conclusions about your work.

## 1. What programming language and libraries did you choose to perform the different tasks (data ingestion, statistical analysis, visualization)?

> [YOUR ANSWER]

## 2. Data ingestion and processing 
Download data from the S3 bucket and process it into a format suitable for analysis. Provide details of how you accessed the data, cleaned it up and prepared it for analysis.

## 3. Descriptive Analysis  
Using simple visualizations and descriptive statistics, describe the location data contained in this dataset. (ie how many places, what categories are present in Philadelphia?)

 ## 4. Time Series Analysis  

Analyze foot-traffic trends over a 7 day period in Philadelphia by category of place type (ie cafes, bars, etc). You will also need to develop a method to group together places with similar trends across that week - explain your reasoning as to why these should be grouped together as well as your approach used for clustering them together. Finally provide some insights based on this grouping/clustering exercise you have undertaken.
