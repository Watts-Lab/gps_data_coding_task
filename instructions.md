# GPS Mobility Data Analysis Take Home Task for Research Assistants

Welcome to the GPS Mobility Data Analysis take home task for research assistants at Wattslab!

This task is intended to test your coding, data analysis, and visualization skills and will be taken into account when considering your application. We expect this task to take around three hours of work, but you can have a whole week if needed. 

The goal of this task is to analyze and visualize visits data from Foursquare stored in .snappy.parquet format in the folder called “fsq-visits”. Each particular visit has zip codes of the venue where it happened as well as zip codes of residence of each visitor included. Your results should be presented in a short report emailed to shape@seas.upenn.edu with all code and graphics used for producing them also attached (you can choose any programming language that you prefer). 

## 1. Data ingestion and processing 
Download data from the Github repository and process it into a format suitable for analysis. Provide details of how you accessed the data, cleaned it up, and prepared it for analysis. 

## 2. Descriptive statistics
Produce descriptive statistics about the number of visits of each residential zip code, the top visited post codes in Philadelphia, and whether these change over time. 

## 3. Visualization
Plot the top visited post codes for a few home post codes and answer whether it seems like users mostly visit zip codes close to their home. Produce an overlay on a map of Philadelphia using geopandas or another library of your choice. 

## 4. Clustering and Analysis 
Restrict your analysis to the month of February, and figure out a way of clustering together home zip codes according to their visitation patterns. Explain your clustering procedure, its advantages, and its limitations. Perform the same exercise for the month of March, do you get the same results? Are any differences due to the nature of algorithm or because mobility patterns have changed? 

## 5 Overall Reflection   
How much time did it take you to complete this task? How did you approach this task? If given more time what are additional extensions or improvements that could be made? 

## Conclusion
We look forward to reviewing your work! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need help understanding any part of this task - we are here to help!
